## Introduction to Dependency Injection

Before diving into Dagger 2, it's important to understand the concept of dependency injection and its benefits in Android development. This section provides a brief overview of why dependency injection is essential and how it can improve the maintainability and testability of your Android applications.

## Getting Started

In this section, you'll set up your development environment and create a basic Android project. You'll learn how to integrate Dagger 2 into your project using Gradle and configure the necessary components to get started with dependency injection.

## Basic Dagger Concepts

This section introduces you to the fundamental concepts of Dagger 2, including:

- **Injection**: Learn how to annotate fields, methods, and constructors for injection.
- **Components**: Understand the role of Dagger components and how to create them.
- **Modules**: Explore the purpose of Dagger modules and how to define them.

## Component and Module

Dive deeper into Dagger components and modules. Learn how to:

- Create custom components and modules.
- Understand component dependencies.
- Utilize component scopes for managing the lifecycle of injected objects.

## Scopes and Subcomponents

Explore Dagger's scoping mechanism and learn how to create subcomponents. Topics covered include:

- Built-in Scopes (e.g., `@Singleton`).
- Custom Scopes for managing different lifecycles.
- Creating and using subcomponents for more complex injection scenarios.

## Injecting Dependencies

Learn how to perform field, method, and constructor injection in Android classes. This section covers:

- Injecting Android components (e.g., `Activity`, `Fragment`).
- Injecting into custom classes.
- Constructor injection and its benefits.

## Qualifiers and Named Bindings

Understand the need for qualifiers and named bindings when dealing with multiple instances of the same type. Topics covered include:

- Defining and using qualifiers.
- Utilizing named bindings to differentiate between instances.

## Advanced Topics

Explore advanced Dagger 2 features and techniques, including:

- Lazy and Provider injection.
- Assisted injection.
- Multibindings for injecting collections.

## Best Practices

Learn best practices and guidelines for using Dagger 2 effectively in your Android projects. This section covers topics such as:

- Keeping components simple and focused.
- Organizing modules and components.
- Debugging and troubleshooting Dagger-related issues.
